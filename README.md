# Bug Characterization in Machine Learning-based Systems
This Replication Package is intended for replication of results presented in the paper `Bug Characterization in Machine Learning-based Systems` submitted to ICSE2023 in Sep 2022. It contains the data, and our detailed results related to the manual labeling of repositories and issues. This replication package contains 5 folders including
* **keras** : the complete list of Machine Learning (ML)-based systems repositories using _Keras_
* **tensorflow** : the complete list of ML-based systems repositories using _TensorFlow_
* **pytorch** : the complete list of ML-based systems repositories using _PyTorch_
* **repo_labeling** : steps to label **300** ML-based systems repositories by _3_ people
* **issue_labeling** : steps to label **386** closed issues and merged pull requests extracted from ML-based repositories by _3_ people
